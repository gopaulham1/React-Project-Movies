# Movie Flix 

A website that allows users to browse through any movie they've ever seen! 
From a list of about a million movies, users will be able to see their favourites, thanks to the TMDB API incorporated
Further, this project not only uses React but also backend assistances from Tailwind and Appwrite, where we stored user preferences for movies and displayed them in the top 5.
